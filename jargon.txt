Jargon

BFF = backend for frontend

RFC = request for comments, used for major changes

ADR = architectural decision record

Redis tag = custom labels you can apply to database clusters

Redis = open source, key-value database built with an in-memory design that emphasizes speed

non-limited change window = 

RPC = program that listens for incoming RPC requests and provides the requested services

UDP = User Datagram Protocol, connectionless communication protocol for transporting packets across networks

MDCB = multi data center bridge (tyk)

NFC = Near field communication

Keystroke logger = user's keystrokes are monitored and recorded, used for hacking

Rainbow table attack = use precomputed table for caching the outputs of a cryptographic has function

credential stuffing attacks = find username and password, use that everywhere to try to hack into accounts

ARM64 = 64 bit extension of ARM architecture family

ARM = family of architectures for computer processors

Alpine = rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior directly in your markup. like jQuery for the modern web

Javascript runner = tool/framework that facilitates the automation of repetitive tasks in a JavaScript project like code compilation

Amazon Cloud watch = service used for monitoring and observing resources in real time, holds logs

Humio = helps achieve real-time observability of all relevant structured and unstructured production data without disruption. CloudWatch logs are sometimes in there

DDAS (data dependency algebras) = turn dependencies into explicit, programmable entities, that are more fundamental than general dependency analysis. It abstracts how parts of a computation depend on data supplied by other parts at a fine-grained level.

Richardson's maturity level for REST APIs = a way to evaluate the design of RESTful APIs
	Level 0: single URI, single HTTP method
	Level 1: many URI, single HTTP method
	Level 2: many URI, multiple HTTP method
	Level 3: many URI, multiple HTTP methods, resource describes own capabilities, resource describes own interactions

GraphQL = open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs and a query runtime engine

Leaky abstraction = a software abstraction that exposes details that it's supposed to hide...not a good abstraction

Conway's law = the structure of software will mirror the organization that built it

flakiness = tests that fail for unclear reasons

database migrations = process fo transferring data from one data storage system to another and also between data formats and applications. 6 types: storage migration, database migration, application migration, cloud migration, business process migration, data center migration

optimistic/pessimistic concurrency=no locks-system should work/locks-you need training wheels

concurrency = two or more actors are touching the same resource at the same time

contention = competition/conflict over shared resources between multiple processes or devices

ACID properties = atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability

skeuomorphism = used in GUI design to describe interface objects that mimic real world counterparts in how they appear and/or how user can interact with them -- bell for notifs, recycle bin for garbage, etc.
